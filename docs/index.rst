If you don't want to deal with installing `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_ over and over again ....

No messing with virtualenv, pip, etc.

Henry can help you getting a quick visual how your docs will look like.

Features
========
Currently:

- Builds HTML (default)
- Builds HTML in debug mode (reST checks)



.. note::

   Henry is written for the `Plone documentation project <https://docs.plone.org>`_.

   Currently there is no 'easy' way to use your own theme or add-ons !

   This **will** change in the future !!

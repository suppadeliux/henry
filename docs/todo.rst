Development
===========

- add function that checks if you have the image already and if not will tell you that running for 1. timw, so will download first, meaning will take longer the first time
- Document that you need to add the user to a dockergroup
- Write docs about dev/contributing
- Clean up code, remove example and example comments
- Create Makefile for easy and fast releasing and go package updates
